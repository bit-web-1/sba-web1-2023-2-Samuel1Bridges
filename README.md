## Conditions

This assessment is open book. You may not communicate with any other person by message or otherwise during the exam. You may be asked to conduct a code defense at some time after the exam, so you need to be able to explain all code that you submit in your answers.

If you have any questions please raise your hand and wait for assistance. Please be considerate of other students and keep noise to a minimum. When you have finished you should log out and leave - please do not continue to do other things on the computer as it may be distracting to others or may be unclear that you have finished and construed as cheating, e.g. if you are on social media.
